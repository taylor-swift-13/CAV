# hamming_distance

## Problem

Return the number of positions where equal-length strings `a` and `b` differ.

## Requirements

- Implement exactly the named function shown in the reference implementation.
- Use only the language standard library.
- The function must be deterministic and must not read stdin or write stdout.
- Inputs satisfy the stated problem preconditions; behavior outside those preconditions is intentionally unspecified.

## Reference Implementation

```java
class HammingDistance {
    public static int hamming_distance(String a, String b) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {
            if (a.charAt(i) != b.charAt(i)) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
