/*
You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
&& each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it,
&& all buckets have the same capacity.
Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

Example 1:
    Input:
        grid : {{0,0,1,0}, {0,1,0,0}, {1,1,1,1}}
        bucket_capacity : 1
    Output: 6

Example 2:
    Input:
        grid : {{0,0,1,1}, {0,0,0,0}, {1,1,1,1}, {0,1,1,1}}
        bucket_capacity : 2
    Output: 5

Example 3:
    Input:
        grid : {{0,0,0}, {0,0,0}}
        bucket_capacity : 5
    Output: 0

Constraints:
    * all wells have the same length
    * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
    * 1 <= grid{:,1}.length <= 10^2
    * grid{i}{j} -> 0 | 1
    * 1 <= capacity <= 10
