# Tri

## Problem (HumanEval 130)

Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
tri(1) = 3
tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
For example:
tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
tri(4) = 3
tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
       = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a vector of the 
first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
Examples:
tri(3) = {1, 3, 2, 8}

## Reference Implementation

```c
typedef struct {
    int* data;
    int size;
} IntArray;

IntArray tri(int n){
    IntArray out;
    out.size = n + 1;
    out.data = (int*)malloc((size_t)(n + 1) * sizeof(int));
    if (out.data == NULL) {
        out.size = 0;
        return out;
    }
    out.data[0] = 1;
    if (n==0) return out;
    out.data[1] = 3;
    for (int i=2;i<=n;i++)
    {
        if (i%2==0) out.data[i] = 1+i/2;
        else out.data[i] = out.data[i-1]+out.data[i-2]+1+(i+1)/2;
    }
    return out;
}
```
