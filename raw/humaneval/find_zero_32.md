# Find Zero 32

## Problem (HumanEval 32)



## Reference Implementation

```c
double poly(double* xs, int xs_size, double x){
    /* 
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x. return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n 
    */
    double sum=0;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<xs_size;i++)
    {
        sum+=xs[i]*pow(x,i);
    }
    return sum;
}

double find_zero_32(double* xs, int xs_size){
    /*
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial. find_zero_32 find x such that poly(x) = 0. find_zero_32 returns only only zero point, even if there are many. 
    Moreover, find_zero_32 only takes list xs having even number of coefficients && largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    >>> round(find_zero_32([1, 2]), 2) #f(x) = 1 + 2x 
    -0.5 
    >>> round(find_zero_32([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3 
    1.0
    */
    double ans=0;
    double value;
    value=poly(xs,xs_size,ans);
    while (fabs(value)>1e-6)
    {
        double driv=0;
        for (int i=1;i<xs_size;i++)
        {
            driv+=xs[i]*pow(ans,i-1)*i;
